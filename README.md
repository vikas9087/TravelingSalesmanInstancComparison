# Traveling Salesman
[Traveling Salesman(TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is a standard problem and have seen a huge progress over the years. This is an [NP Hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness). Various algorithms have been used for both exact methods and heuristics to solve the TSP.

## Objective
I am always eager to learn and explore. I am recently learning more about [metaheuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic), better programming, using solvers. The objectives of my this project are:

1. Compare the computational time for Genetic Algorithm, Using Gurobi's CallBack functions to add [Subtour Elimination Constraints (SEC)](https://medium.com/swlh/techniques-for-subtour-elimination-in-traveling-salesman-problem-theory-and-implementation-in-71942e0baf0c), adding SEC using graphs, Gurobi's Start Method.
2. Second objective is to learn better coding practices using PyCharm and Python. Objective was to build the code from software building perspectives.
3. Learning Gurobi's features.


## Work In Progress
Currently, I have build the classes to build these models. One model where utilizing MTZ formulation is yet to code. Then compare the the compuation time and objective value for different number of cities.
